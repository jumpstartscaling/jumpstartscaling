  <section>
    <div class="container grid-2-bias">
      <div>
        <h2>The Referral Trap</h2>
        <p>
          Referrals are great until they stop. You cannot scale a business on hope. To <strong>engineer predictable revenue with paid acquisition</strong>, you need a system, not just a "boost post" button.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most founders treat ads like a slot machine. They put a dollar in and hope for a jackpot. We treat ads like an investment portfolio. If you don't have a scientific method for testing creatives, audiences, and offers, you are just donating money to Mark Zuckerberg.

      <h2>The 3 Phases of Paid Scale</h2>
      <p>
        Scaling isn't linear. It happens in step-functions. Understanding where you are in this cycle is critical to avoiding wasted spend.
      </p>

      <div class="process-flow">
        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="step-number">1</div>
          <div class="step-title">Alpha Phase (Testing)</div>
          <p class="step-desc">
            The goal here is not profit; it is data. We spend small amounts across many variables to find "Signal." We are looking for a Click-Through Rate (CTR) above 1% and a Cost Per Lead (CPL) within KPIs.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="step-number">2</div>
          <div class="step-title">Beta Phase (Validation)</div>
          <p class="step-desc">
            Once we find a winning angle, we double down. we introduce variations of the winning creative. We begin to optimize the landing page (CRO) to ensure the traffic converts.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="step-number">3</div>
          <div class="step-title">Scale Phase (Domination)</div>
          <p class="step-desc">
            The budget is uncapped. As long as the Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) stays above 3.0x, we spend as much as possible. We expand to new channels (YouTube, TikTok) using the proven winning angles.
